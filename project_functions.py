The following functions are used for the PH456 essay. The RK4 function describes
a Runge-Kutta 4 routine, and it is used to solve the VdP Differential Equation
(DE). Its inputs are x0 (initial amplitude), v0 (initial velocity), tf (final
time), h (imposed timestep), dvdt (the function to solve), val (the inputs of 
dvdt, exept x0, v0). it returns the time array t over which the amplitude xpos
and velocity v were calculated.
